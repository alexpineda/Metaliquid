Hey Stranger.

MetaLiquid is a basic 'crawler' that will grab textual information from local or online xml/html elements and attributes.
Crawling instructions are written in json, and results are spit out as json as well.
Original intent: create a tag cloud site with starcraft player elo as the size determinant.

Example instructions can be found in crawler/instructions/
Example output from those instructions can be found in crawler/data

crawler/run_crawler.php is the entry point for updating the data based on the instructions.

The goal is to now use this data for a front-end application where users can click on a cloud tag name (player name in the eg.)
and have a box come out with details (eg. latest game vod, etc.) and perhaps a wiki like functionality tieing extra data to the identifier.
Although choosing the player name as an identifier is somewhat problematic as players may change their names (rare as it is however).

TODO:
For some reason I'm ditching the instruction id, and title attributes and simply storing an array in the output file with the
rows. Fix this so that in the future perhaps we can use couchdb and tags, and plus its not nice to use filenames.

Note:
Keep in mind in code and configuration, that row and column aren't necessarily real rows and columns. It's just the
way I use them that gave them that name (html tables), so there is potential use for other non tabular uses.
