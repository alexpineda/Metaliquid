Hey Stranger.

MetaLiquid is a basic 'crawler' that will grab textual information from local or online xml/html elements and attributes.
Crawling instructions are written in json, and results are spit out as json as well.
It's a generic system, however the config and the front end are setup for the specific implementation.
The original idea was to create a tag cloud site with starcraft player elo as the size determinant, stripped from tl.net tlpd (ahem API?).

Example instructions can be found in crawler/instructions/
Example output from those instructions can be found in crawler/data

crawler/run_crawler.php is the entry point for updating the data based on the instructions.

The goal is to now use this data for a front-end application where users can click on a cloud tag name (player name in the eg.)
and have a box come out with details (eg. latest game vod, etc.) and perhaps a wiki like functionality tieing extra data to the identifier.
Although choosing the player name as an identifier is somewhat problematic as players may change their names (rare as it is however).

TODO:
Use some sort of database for historical recording.
Front end:
Better UI. Have the crawler be able to go deeper and attach more data to a
a player. Have an 'attachments' box for each player where users can draw graffiti, add links, add images.
Create a streams section tagged sized by viewer count, or thread comment count.
The client loads all the json files upon load. This is perhaps too slow. There should be a 'header' file that contains
all meta data about the json files, and the collections can be within the individual collection files.

Note:
Keep in mind in code and configuration, that row and column aren't necessarily real rows and columns. It's just the
way I use them that gave them that name (html tables), so there is potential use for other non tabular uses.
